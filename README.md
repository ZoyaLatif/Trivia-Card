Trivia Card from Codecademy: JQuery Effects
In this project, I have followed step-by-step instructions to add jQuery Effects to the Trivia Card on the right. We want the user to be able to read the clue, view an optional hint, and select their answer.
I have added a few different effects. A hint box will slide up and down. When you click an incorrect answer, it will fade away and a frowny face will appear. When you click the correct answer, the frowny face will disappear and a smiley face will take its place.
